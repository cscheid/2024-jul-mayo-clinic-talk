## Tiny bio

- Lead developer for the Quarto project, have worked on the project since joining Posit (fka RStudio) three years ago
- Previous life: computer science academic researcher for over a decade

## Housekeeping

- I'm using Quarto 1.5 for this presentation, and discussing features that shipped with Quarto 1.5 (last week). 
- It's very stable. If you can update, I highly recommend it.
- This presentation itself is a Quarto document published at <https://quarto.pub>: <https://posit-carlos.quarto.pub/mayo-clinic-jul-2024>.
- The source code for the presentation is on GitHub: <https://github.com/cscheid/2024-jul-mayo-clinic-talk>

# Themes: the present

## Quarto themes

- Quarto ships great-looking templates for websites, presentations, PDF reports, dashboards, and more
- It also lets you customize the appearance of all of these formats

## Theming HTML documents

- Predefined themes
- CSS
- SCSS
- Create your own format

::: callout-note

Quarto is designed to grow with you, and offers you complete extensibility when 
you need it. (That, of course, comes with a larger needed effort).

:::

## Predefined themes

Add to your `_quarto.yml` configuration, or to document front matter:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    theme: cerulean
```

Quarto ships with all 25 [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) themes.

:::

## Light + dark modes

Add this:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    theme: 
      light: flatly
      dark: darkly
```

::: footer

Learn more: <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html>

:::

## CSS

Add to your configuration:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    css: my-styles.css
```

The CSS stylesheet will be added to your document, and it can be as simple as

```css
body {
    background-color: #90a0c0;
}
```

## SCSS

To unlock deeper configurability of Quarto's styling, including 1,400+ variables that control fonts, colors, padding, etc, you'll eventually want to learn SCSS. Add to your configuration:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    theme: custom.scss
```

For example:

```scss
/*-- scss:functions --*/ // <- these are needed in Quarto!
@function invert($color, $amount: 100%) {
  $inverse: change-color($color, $hue: hue($color) + 180);
  @return mix($inverse, $color, $amount);
}
/*-- scss:defaults --*/
$primary-color: #036;
/*-- scss:rules --*/
.header {
  background-color: invert($primary-color, 80%);
}
```

## Roll your own format

Quarto lets you create an entirely new custom format, and then
package it so others in your organization can use it.

## Caveats

::: callout-warning

There's one annoying Quarto bug we're going to fix in 1.6: a Quarto project
can only have a single SASS theme for all of its documents.

:::

## RevealJS presentations

- `revealjs` is ultimately an HTML format, and so all of the above applies

- The HTML that Quarto emits in `revealjs` is slightly different from regular webpages, and so the specific themes need to be adapted

::: footer

More on `revealjs` themes: https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html

:::

## PDF reports, 1

- By default, Quarto uses LaTeX for PDF generation
- LaTeX customization happens through LaTeX templates
- Totally different from HTML formats

## PDF reports, 2

- Quarto recently added support for Typst: https://typst.app
- More modern PDF generation. Much less mature ecosystem, but more much more easily customizable
- **Quarto feature highlight**:  Styled tables, see <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html#typst-css>

# Themes: the (near) future

## `v1.6` upcoming feature: `_brand.yml`

- Today: different formats require different theming configurations.

- Quarto lets you write Markdown once and produce websites, reports, books, presentations, emails, etc. So why don't we do the same thing for themes?

::: callout-note

We intend this feature to solve "90%" of the theming requirements across a variety of formats. But, by the very nature of theming customizations, it can never be a
substitute for true custom formats. Still, we expect it to be the feature that
users reach first for when creating "branded documents"

## `_brand.yml`: sneak peek

```yaml
logo:
  small: posit-icon.png
  medium: posit.png
  large: posit.svg
```

## `_brand.yml`: sneak peek

```yaml
color:
  palette:
    blue: "#447099"
    orange: "#EE6331"
    gray: "#404041"
    white: "#FFFFFF"
    teal: "#419599"
    green: "#72994E"
    burgundy: "#9A4665"
  theme:
    foreground: "#151515"
    background: white
    primary: blue
    secondary: "#707073"
    tertiary: "#C2C2C4"
    success: green
    info: teal
    warning: orange
    danger: burgundy
    light: white
    dark: gray
```

## `_brand.yml`: sneak peek

```yaml
typography:
  font:
    - google: "Open Sans"
    - google: "Fira Code"
    - google:
        family: "Roboto Slab"
        weight: 600
        style: normal
        display: block
  base:
    family: "Open Sans"
    line-height: 1.25
    size: 1rem
  headings:
    family: "Roboto Slab"
    color: primary
    weight: 600
  monospace:
    family: "Fira Code"
    size: 0.9em
```

## `_brand.yml` is more than a Quarto feature

`_brand.yml` is designed to cut across a wide swath of Posit-supported products. **NB: no timeline or promise on any of these!!**

- Shiny documents (both R and Python)
- Visualization libraries:
  - concrete plans in R (through `thematic`, so both base R plots and grid graphics ie `ggplot2`)
  - designs being considered for Python ecosystem (specifically Matplotlib theming, so `plotnine`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
